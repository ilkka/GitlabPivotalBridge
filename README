Gitlab to Pivotal Tracker bridge
================================

This app routes Gitlab commit hook requests to Pivotal Tracker's API.
Just run it with 'play "start -Dpivotal.token=abcdefg1234"' and
set "http://<ip:port of this app>/hook" as the Gitlab hook URI. Note
that the actions on the tickets will show up as being made by whichever
user owns the API token you use.

Also, for info on how you need to format your commit messages to make it work,
see https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api?version=v3#scm_post_commit.
